# calorieCounter
counting calories made easy!


when adding items to the food list and setting an amount of calories you want to eat it will be calculated how many 
grams of this item you must eat to get the amount of calories desired. Based on 40% carbs, 30% fat and 30% protein.



when adding a list like this:

oats:                   75 carbs, 7.9 fat, 8.2 protein in 100 grams 
yoghurt:                11.2 carbs, 7.5 fat, 10 protein in 250 grams
beef stew:              0 carbs, 9.5 fat, 20.1 protein in 100 grams
fries:                  76 carbs, 30 fat, 10 protein in 200 grams
chopped vegan meat:     8 carbs, 0.7 fat, 21 protein in 100 grams
kidneybeans:            20.8 carbs, 0.9 fat, 11.5 protein in 150 grams
ma誰s:                   7.7 carbs, 1.4 fat, 2.1 protein in 70 grams
tomatoes:               8 carbs, 0.2 fat, 2 protein in 200 grams
rice:                   76 carbs, 1.1 fat, 7.3 protein in 100 grams
kwark:                  20 carbs, 0 fat, 45 protein in 500 grams
nutbar:                 11 carbs, 18 fat, 6.5 protein in 50 grams
prote誰nshake:           1.4 carbs, 0 fat, 29.4 protein in 30 grams

with 2700 calories the outcome will be:

oats:                   70.3 grams
yoghurt:                347.2 grams
beef stew:              164.5 grams
fries:                  193.4 grams
chopped vegan meat:     118.4 grams
kidneybeans:            105.5 grams
ma誰s:                   49.2 grams
tomatoes:               142.1 grams
rice:                   71.1 grams
kwark:                  592.2 grams
nutbar:                 68.7 grams
prote誰nshake:           35.5 grams

If there is no outcome, either the list is too short or or the amount of calories is too low, 
which makes a calculation not possible
